# PSN - PHP style node. 

Same thing as PHP except you get to use javascript code in place of php code. Code delimiters are `<%` and `%>`

## Example

    <p>Here's some html. <%= 'Heres some dynamic output'+user.name %> </p>

## Install

    npm install devinrhode2/psn
    
    //if this doesn't work... do:
    npm install git://github.com/devinrhode2/psn
    
    //The above install feature is in the latest npm and I think it'll be released in node 0.8.13
